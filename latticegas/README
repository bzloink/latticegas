Two-dimensional square lattice gas model
by Andrew M. Launder

This program takes a random square lattice of two molecular types (A and B)
as the input for the 2D lattice gas model.

Once you've compiled the program, ensure that your working directory contains a file named "input.dat".
    
    The first line of this file is a comment line, and has no effect on the program output.
    Each of the remaining lines should be structured as follows:
        keyword keyword_value
    The available keywords are as follows:
    
    temp: the temperature of the Boltzmann distribution law (REQUIRED).
    
    nsnaps: the number of snapshots (lattices) to produce.
    
    niters: the number of iterations used in the Metropolis algorithm.
    
    xdim: the first dimension of the lattice (in number of cells).
    
    ydim: the second dimension of the lattice (in number of cells).
    
    na: the number of A-type molecules.
    
    nb: the number of B-type molecules.
    
    eaa: the energy of the A-A interactions.
    
    ebb: the energy of the B-B interactions.
    
    eab: the energy of the A-B interactions.
    
    color: controls color-coded lattice printing.
           Default value is "n", indicating that color-coded lattice(s) WILL NOT be printed to the standard output stream.
           The other option is "y", indicating that color-coded lattice(s) WILL be printed to the standard output stream.
    
Once you have prepared your input file, enter the following into the command line:
    
    path/to/executable/latticegas.exe
    
This program will write three types of output files:
    
    output.dat: main output file.
                Only one of these will be written.
                Contains simulation parameters and initial lattice data,
                as well as final lattice data for each snapshot.
    
    .energy files: for a given snapshot,
                   the energy of each iteration.
    
    .GraphGeod files: for a given snapshot,
                      the resultant graph,
                      as well as the A-A, B-B, and A-B layers,
                      formatted as ChemNetworks .GraphGeod outputs.
    
    .xyz file: for a given snapshot,
               the resultant Cartesian coordinates,
               as well as those for the A-A, B-B, and A-B graph layers.
    
Note that periodic boundary conditions are in use.
